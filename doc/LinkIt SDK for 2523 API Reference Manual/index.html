Overview</h1>
<p>MediaTek LinkIt™ Development Platform for RTOS provides a comprehensive software solution for devices based on the MediaTek MT2523x SOC, including the LinkIt™ 2523 hardware development kit (HDK). The platform supports hardware abstraction layers, peripheral drivers, FreeRTOS, Bluetooth / Bluetooth Low Energy (BT/BLE), Sensor subsystem and GNSS. This API reference describes the features of and how to use the APIs for each of the supported modules. Each module has a readme.txt under the module root directory. It contains the information about the module dependency, feature options, notes and brief introduction. Please refer to the readme.txt to learn the basic usage of the module.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="SDK_Key_features"></a>
Major Features</h1>
<p>The SDK supports the following features when used with the LinkIt 2523 HDK or devices based on the MT2523x:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ATCI</b><br />
 ATCI module provides the interface for target communication with command line tools operating through the UART. ATCI also provides functions to register the AT command handler, receive/send UART data and a parser to search the registered AT command handler. The command handler gets and parses all the input AT command data, then handles the corresponding action.</li>
<li><b>Battery management</b><br />
 Battery management system is a battery monitor mechanism that controls the charging and discharging of rechargeable batteries and provides APIs to acquire battery information including capacity, temperature, charging current, cable status, etc.</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy</b><br />
 Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy contains two modules: Basic Rate / Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy, released as a single library.</p>
<p class="startli">BR/EDR module includes the following profiles: GAP, SPP, Hands Free Profile (HFP), Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) and Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP).</p>
<p class="startli">Bluetooth Low Energy module includes the following profiles: GAP, GATT and Security Manager (SM).</p>
</li>
<li><b>HAL</b><br />
 HAL provides convenient and easy-to-use driver APIs encapsulating the low-level functionality of the peripheral drivers. These APIs can interact with the upper layers, such as the middleware and the OS. In addition, HAL also includes several system modules, such as cache, micro processor unit (MPU), flash, etc.</li>
<li><b>Sensor subsystem</b><br />
 The sensor subsystem provides information on human activity statistics, gesture detection and pedestrian dead reckoning. The components included in the driver module are the physical sensor driver, fusion algorithm library and APIs for applications that require obtaining driver and algorithm data. The SDK enables to port third party sensor drivers. Different fusion algorithm libraries can also be plugged-in, instead of the source libraries provided by MediaTek.</li>
<li><b>FOTA</b><br />
 FOTA enables updating the firmware of an IoT device using wireless communication, such as Bluetooth. It offers full and separate bin firmware update mechanisms. LinkIt SDK includes a demo reference design on how to push packages using Bluetooth communication.</li>
<li><b>GNSS</b><br />
 GNSS is part of All-in-GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) offered by MediaTek. The GNSS module provides a unified method to interpret the received GNSS data based on the National Marine Electronics Association (<a href="http://www.nmea.org/">NMEA</a>) specification. It also enables sending commands to an on-board GNSS chip.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Other features</b><br />
 The SDK provides utilities, such as XML supporting Entity, Index, Search and JSON supporting string parser.</li>
</ul>
