@par Overview
  - Example description
    - Potential users of this project are developers who want to create their
      own project with BT and FreeRTOS and the purpose of this project is to
      demonstrate how to achieve this goal on the basis of this project.
    - This example describes how to initialize hardware infrastructure and
      main function features of LinkIt 2523 board by SAC.
  - How to create your own project based on this project
    - Clone this project to apps folder and rename it to your own project
      name.
    - Hardware initialization and tasks creation other than BT part, please
      follow comments described in the main.c of this project.
  - Features of the example project
    - The project initializes the hardware and demonstrates how to create
      user-defined applications.
  - Result
    - The log will show the system initialization flow.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported HDK
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - N/A.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the demo
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    freertos_initialize_main_features" from the SDK root folder and download
    the binary file to LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The log will show "system up" and "Supplicant Ready".
    This indicates a successful operation.
