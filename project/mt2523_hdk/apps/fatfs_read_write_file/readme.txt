@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This application demonstrates how to use FatFS to access a file stored on SD/eMMC.
    - The application does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - Log will show whether the file is read and written successfully.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - Connect J1001.2 to J1001.3;
    - Connect J1002.2 to J1002.3;
    - Connect J1003.2 to J1003.3;
    - Connect J1004.2 to J1004.3;
    - Connect J1005.2 to J1005.3;
    - Connect J1006.2 to J1006.3;
  - Note:
    - It's recommended to apply correct configuration for the switches and pins to
      ensure successful operation of the SD/eMMC and FatFs based applications. The
      EPT configuration of GPIO30/GPIO31/GPIO32/GPIO33/GPIO34/GPIO35 for this
      application is to enable SD/eMMC and it is different from common EPT configuration.

  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the application
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    fatfs_read_write_file" from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable, and open
    the port with the name "mbed Serial Port". Connect all the switches
    described in "HDK switches and pin configuration" section and insert an
    SD card.
  - Run the application. The transaction result is displayed in the log and
    "The file is written and read successfully!" indicates a successful
    access to a file.
