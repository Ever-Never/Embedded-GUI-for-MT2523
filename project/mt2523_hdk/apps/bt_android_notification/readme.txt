@par Overview
  - Application project description
    - This application demonstrates a simple and convenient way to access
      various types of notifications generated from Android notification
      center.
  - Features of the application
    - This application supports the notifications received in the
      notification center on the Android smartphone.
  - Process / procedure of the sample
    - Output from the application project: The notifications will show in the
      log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Remote device configuration
    - Install the MediaTek SmartDevice APK on an Android smartphone.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the demo
  - Build the application project with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    bt_android_notification" from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect your board to the PC with a micro USB-cable.
  - Power on the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect to LinkIt 2523 HDK from Android smartphone using Mediatek
    SmartDevice APK
  - The notifications will be received.
  - The notification will show in the log on the connected SecureCRT or Hyper
    Terminal. Note: you could filter"Noti_S"&"Noti_E" to check the
    notification content.
