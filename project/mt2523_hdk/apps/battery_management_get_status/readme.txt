@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This application demonstrates how to use the battery management APIs to
      capture battery information such as capacity and temperature.
  - Application features
    - This application demonstrates how to get the battery status.
    - Battery management is enabled to obtain the battery status.
  - Results
    - Log will show the received battery information.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported HDK
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Hardware environment
    - Need a battery to power on the device.
    - Adapter or USB cable to charge the battery.
    - Connect the jumper J2001 pins 1 and 2 to set the power source from
      battery connector. The configuration details can be found in the
      "Hardware Feature Configuration" of the LinkIt 2523 HDK user's guide.
  - Environment configuration
    - This application will output logs via MK20 USB to PC. Please connect a
      micro-USB cable from a PC to MK20 USB port, install the mbed serial
      driver, and launch Tera terminal in PC for logging.
      - Require a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of PC and
        micro-B USB of the LinkIt 2523 HDK development board. For more
        information about type-A plug and micro-B plug, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Install the mbed serial driver as the instructions of
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to the "Installing the LinkIt 2523 HDK
        drivers" section of the "LinkIt 2523 HDK user's guide" [sdk_root]/doc
        folder.
      - A serial tool for UART loggging is required, such as Tera terminal.
        Please refer to the installing Tera terminal section of get started
        guide under [sdk_root]/doc folder for more information.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the application
  - Build the application with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    battery_management_get_status" from the SDK root folder and download the
    binary file to LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Run the application. The log will periodically show battery and charging
    information.
  - Application logs are shown below:
    \code
    Battery capacity = 66(%)
    Battery capacity level = 4
    Charger current = 285(mA)
    Charger status = 1(0:charge not exist; 1:charger exist)
    Charger type = 2(0:unknown; 1:standard host; 2:non-standard AC charger;
    3:standard AC charger 4:charging host)
    Battery temperature = 26(Celsius degrees)
    Battery voltage = 3890(mV)
