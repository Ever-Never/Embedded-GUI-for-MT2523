@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This application demonstrates how to create a graphical user interface
      (GUI) on an embedded system with limited resources using TouchGFX
      framework written in C++.
  - Application features
    - Three clocks, including two analog clocks and one digital clock.
    - Heart Rate. Provides heart rate using MediaTek MT2511 biosensor
      daughterboard.
    - Settings. Enables to configure the clock, date/time, GNSS, Bluetooth,
      Sensor heart rate and backlight (on or off).
  - TouchGFX License
    - Please refer to http://touchgfx.com/en/services-pricing/licenses/.
    - Current project uses Roboto fonts that can be found at Source Sans Pro
      https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/source-sans-pro.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK
    - LCM module driven by Sitronix ST7789H2 (or another driver IC that
      supports MediaTek 2-data lane interface).
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - LCD module's pin mapping is listed below.
      |PIN Name    |GPIOx    |PINx    |
      |------------|---------|--------|

      |  LPTE      |  43     |        |
  - Environment configuration
    - TouchGFX build flow is in two parts. First, generate resources
      including build image, text and font. Then compile the source code.
    - Linux Environment TouchGFX requires Ruby to generate resource files in
      Linux environment. Ruby is installed on most Linux distributions, by
      default. Follow these steps to determine if Ruby is installed and, if
      not, install the Ruby instructions at
      http://ruby.about.com/od/tutorials/ht/installrubylin.htm. Default
      version is ruby 1.9.3p484 (2013-11-22 revision 43786) In addition,
      download rubyzip from https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip. Download roo
      from https://github.com/roo-rb/roo. Download nokogiri from
      http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html. After
      download, please export Ruby environment such as: export
      RUBYLIB=/intall_path/nokogiri-master/:/intall_path/nokogiri-
      master/1.9.1/ x86_64-linux/:/intall_path/rubyzip-
      master/lib/:/intall_path/roo-master/lib/.
    - Windows Environment Download and install rubyinstaller.exe from
      https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rubyinstaller
      (Default is 2.3.1 x64 version) Download and Unzip Rubygems from
      https://rubygems.org/pages/download (Default is rubygems-2.6.8.zip)
      Enter windows console and cd install_path/rubygems-2.6.8 Execute ruby
      setup.rb install Open MinGW console Install roo package using command:
      gem install roo Install rubyzip package command: gem install rubyzip
      Install nokogiri package command: gem install nokogiri

@par run the application
  - How to build the watch_demo application
    - GCC version
      - make command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk watch_ref_design" under the SDK
        root folder.
    - Keil IDE using version MDK515
      - Open "watch_ref_design.uvprojx" under the MDK-ARM folder and build
        the Keil project.
  - How to download the watch_demo application
    - Please install and use MT2523 flash tool
      (sdk_root/tools/PC_tool_Win.zip) to download watch_demo.bin to the
      LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - How to run each feature
    - Power on LinkIt 2523 HDK and the clock will be displayed. Press power
      key to switch the screen to heart rate, GNSS, sports mode or settings
      screen. On Settings, press the power key to open the detailed settings.
      Press the power key again, to return to the previous display.
