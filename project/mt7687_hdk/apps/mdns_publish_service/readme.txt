@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This application shows the usage of mDNS APIs.
  - Application features
    - This application demonstrates how to start an mDNS daemon task and
      publish an mDNS service based on the following steps:
    - 1. Start an mDNS daemon task.
    - 2. Publish an mDNS service with a TXT record.
    - 3. Update the TXT record.
    - 4. Unregister the service and stop the mDNS daemon task.
  - Results
    - The output is in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7687
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7687 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7687 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.
      - Configure a Wi-Fi router with the SSID as SQA_TEST_AP, password as
        77777777, and authentication mode as WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK.
      - You can change the SSID and password in main.c to match these of your
        Wi-Fi Access Point.
  - Customization Option
    - \b MTK_MDNS_ENABLE:  Define this parameter in your application to use the
                           mDNSResponder functions, such as publish an mDNS
                           service. This option is defined in <sdk_root>/middle
                           ware/third_party/mDNSResponder/module.mk.
