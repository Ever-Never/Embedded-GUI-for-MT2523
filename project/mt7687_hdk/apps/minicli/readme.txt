@par Overview
  - Example project description
    - This project is a reference application to create a MiniCLI task with
      custom defined commands.
  - Features of the example project
    - This project creates a CLI task and waits for the user input through a
      serial port.
  - Output from the example
    - An output log is printed on the serial port window.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported HDK
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7687
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7687 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7687 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the demo
  - Connect the board to the PC with a serial port cable.
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt7687_hdk
    minicli" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to LinkIt
    7687 development board.
  - '$' shows on the screen. CLI task waits for the user input. For example,
    enter 'hello' (an example command in this project), 'Hello World' is
    printed on screen.
  - Try to add your own command.
