@par Overview
  - Application description
    - httpd is a reference application to demonstrate the usage of HTTPD
      APIs. It demonstrate how to initialize, start and stop an HTTP server.
  - Application features
    - This application explain how to:
    - 1. Initialize an HTTP server.
    - 2. Start the HTTP server.
    - 3. Access to the HTTP server with HTTP request.
    - 4. Stop the HTTP server.
  - Results
    - The output is in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7687
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7687 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7687 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.
      - Configure a Wi-Fi router with the SSID as SQA_TEST_AP, password as
        77777777 and authentication mode as WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK. The Wi-Fi
        router should have internet connection.
      - You can change the default settings in main.c to match the SSID and
        password of the existing Wi-Fi Access Point.
