@par Run the example
  - Copy files generated by EPT to the target project location.
    - Copy ept_gpio_var.c and ept_eint_var.c to
      /project/mt7687_hdk/hal_examples/ept_configure_pins_by_ept/src/.
    - Copy ept_eint_drv.h and ept_gpio_drv.h to
      /project/mt7687_hdk/hal_examples/ept_configure_pins_by_ept/inc/.
    - Copy program files for pin initialization to the target project folder
      and make sure the files can be built, then call
      ept_gpio_setting_init() from the program file main.c.
    - Call the API bsp_ept_gpio_setting_init() to initialize the
      pins configured by the EPT.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable
    and specify the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Build the example project with a command
    "./build.sh mt7687_hdk ept_configure_pins_by_ept"
    from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Run the example. The log "Pins have been initialized
    according to the configuration of EPT." indicates a successful operation.

@par Configuration
  - There are several variable names that can be assigned to different pins
    using EPT based on hardware and software design. All the GPIO and EINT
    variable names and the role assignment are provided in the table below.
    The software can use variable names to configure the corresponding pins
    without the need to know the pin number in the low level. This simplifies
    porting the software to different platforms.
  - As for the GPIO variable names, it is necessary to assign the GPIO
    variable name to the correct pin according to the current pinmux settings
    or the corresponding peripheral may not work properly or the platform may
    not boot. For example, if a pin works in KCOL1 mode for keypad, the
    assigned variable name should be "HAL_KEYPAD_COL2_PIN" or the keypad
    module may not operate properly. The role assignment of all the GPIO
    variable names can be obtained from the table below
  - EINT variable names and pins should be assigned similar to GPIO pins,
    only on EINT page of the EPT. For example, if a pin is configured to work
    in EINT mode for ACCDET, the variable name "HAL_ACCDET_EINT" should be
    assigned to this pin, or the ACCDET module may not operate properly or
    the platform may not boot.
  - The variable names and role assignment can be obtained from the table
    below, please pay extra attention on the comment field.
