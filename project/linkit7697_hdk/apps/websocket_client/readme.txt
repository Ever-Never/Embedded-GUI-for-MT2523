@par Overview
  - Application description
    - Websocket is a communication protocol, which provides full-duplex
      communication channels over a single TCP connection. This application
      is a demonstration of a websocket client.
  - Features of the application
    - Connect to a websocket server.
    - Send data to the server.
    - Receive data from the server.
    - Disconnect to the server.
  - Results
    - The output is collected in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7697
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7697 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7697 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the application
  - Build the application with the command "./build.sh linkit7697_hdk
    websocket_client" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file
    to the LinkIt 7697 evelopment board.
  - Connect your board to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Set up a WiFi router which connects to the internet.
    - Router settings: name: SQA_TEST_AP, password: 77777777, auth mode:
      WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK.
    - You can also change the default settings in main.c to adapt the device
      to your Wi-Fi Access Point by specifying authentication mode,
      encryption mode, SSID, and password.
  - Run the application. The transaction result is displayed in the log.
    "example project test success" printed in the log indicates a success.
